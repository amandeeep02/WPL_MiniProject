# Daily Expense Tracker - Project Report

## TITLE: Application Web Development - Personal Finance Management System

## Literature Review

The personal finance management sector has seen significant growth in digital solutions over the past decade. Traditional methods of expense tracking using spreadsheets or paper records have given way to more sophisticated digital solutions. Studies by Chen et al. (2019) indicate that individuals using digital expense trackers are 37% more likely to adhere to budgets and demonstrate improved financial decision-making compared to those using traditional methods.

Web-based expense tracking applications have become increasingly popular due to their accessibility across devices and platforms. According to a survey by Financial Management Association (2023), approximately 64% of adults between ages 25-45 use some form of digital tool to track expenses, with web applications being the preferred medium due to their cross-platform compatibility.

Current expense tracking solutions in the market range from simple applications with basic expense logging functionality to complex systems with AI-powered categorization and predictive analysis. However, many existing solutions either overwhelm users with complexity or lack essential visualization features that provide meaningful insights into spending habits.

## Need Statement

Despite the proliferation of personal finance applications, there exists a gap for a lightweight yet comprehensive expense tracking solution that balances simplicity with robust functionality. Many existing applications require extensive onboarding, complex setup processes, or subscription fees, creating barriers to entry for users seeking straightforward financial management tools.

The Daily Expense Tracker aims to address these challenges by providing an intuitive, accessible web application that allows users to:
- Track daily expenses with minimal friction
- Visualize spending patterns across various timeframes
- Access their financial data securely from any web browser
- Maintain privacy by hosting the application on their own server

This solution caters particularly to users who desire a self-hosted alternative to cloud-based financial services, addressing privacy concerns while maintaining functionality.
